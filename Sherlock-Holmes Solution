In the book on page 122, I felt the solution wasn't really shown or understood. Because of that I tried to get to code to operate as intended. 
The original code in the book is:
var balance = 10500;
var cameraOn = true;

function steal(balance, amount){
  cameraOn = false;
  if (amount < balance) {
    balance = balance - amount;
    }
    return amount;
    cameraOn=true;
   }
   
var amount = steal(balance, 1250);
alert("Criminal: you stole " + amount + "!");

Because the balance variable is shadowed in the function parameters, this code will not subtract the stolen amount from the global balance variable.
Doing this causes the function to think "balance" is a new local variable, and therefore does not take away from the global variable. 
Also, cameraOn=true is set AFTER the return statement, which would never turn the camera back on. 

A soulution that could work that I figured out is: 

var balance = 10500;
var cameraOn = true;

function steal(amount){
    cameraOn = false;
    if (amount < balance){
        balance = balance - amount;
    }
    cameraOn = true;
    return amount;
}

var amount = steal(1250);
alert('Criminal: You stole' + amount + '!');
//this section shows the code works as intended
alert(balance);
alert(cameraOn);

I added the additional alerts to show the code is working as intended, and fixed the camera to turn it back on. 
Copy and paste this code into your HTML file to experiment with it :)


After playing around with this some more I made it into a little mini-game. It now asks you if you want to help or steal.
Paste the code below into your HTML file and open it via a live server. 
Be careful and don't get greedy!

var balance = 10500;
var cameraOn = true;

function steal(amount){
  alert('There is ' + balance + " in this account")
  answer = prompt('Do you want to help? Or Steal?')
  cameraOn = false;
  console.log(cameraOn);
  if (answer == "steal"){
    var amount = Number(prompt('How much do you want to steal?'));
    if(amount > balance){
      alert("That's too much, your greed got you caught!");
      return
    }
    balance = balance - amount;
    alert("You stole: " + amount + "!");
  }else if (answer == "help"){
    var amount = Number(prompt('How much do you want to add to this account?'));
    balance = balance + amount;
    alert("Thank for helping! You added " + amount + " to this account")
  }else{
    console.log('enter a different amount');
  }
  cameraOn = true;
  return amount
}

var amount = steal(10500);
console.log(balance)
console.log(cameraOn);
